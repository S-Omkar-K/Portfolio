<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/food-inspections-imagery.jpeg"> **[Chicago Food Inspections](https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/News-Articles-Recommendation)**
 
In this project I Leveraged PySpark to develop a machine learning model predicting restaurant ratings based on public inspection comments. The model pipeline combined text pre-processing (Tokenizer, HashingTF) with Logistic Regression, analyzing the **["Chicago Food Inspections"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chicago/chi-restaurant-inspections)** dataset.

<img align="right" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/worldbank-logo.jpeg"> **[Automated Data Scraping using AirFlow DAG](https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/python-projects/tree/main/airflow-automated-webscraping)**

In this project I have developed an automated data scraper in Python to collect World Bank data at set intervals. Integrated the scraper with AirFlow's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for efficient scheduling and execution.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/unemployment-imagery.jpeg"> **[Unemployment Analysis - NLP and Predictive Modelling](https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/python-projects/tree/main/unemployment-analysis-nlp-shiny-python)**

Developed a dynamic and interactive Shiny app with a Python backend to analyze and visualize monthly changes in economic indicators related to unemployment. The project incorporates several key elements:
Data Visualization: Users can explore interactive charts and graphs depicting key unemployment metrics, allowing for insightful trend analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Leverages spaCy to extract sentiment from news articles and labor bureau reports, providing a deeper understanding of public and economic perspectives on unemployment.
Predictive Modeling: Users can input new reports and estimate future unemployment rates based on extracted sentiment and economic factors, empowering proactive decision-making.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/phase1.jpg"> **[Multivariate Phase 1 Analysis](https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/Multivariate-Phase-1-Analysis)** 

Objective of this project is to identify the in-control data points and eliminate out of control data points to set up distribution parameters for manufacturing process monitoring. I utilized PCA for dimension reduction and Hotelling T2 and m-CUSUM control charts to established mean and variance matrices.

#

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/gdp.jpg"> **[What's the GDP of India?](https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/Predicting-GDP-of-India)**

Objective of this project is to perform predictive assesment on the GDP of India through an inferential analysis of various socio-economic factors. Various models are compared and Stepwise Regression model is implemented which resulted in 5.7% Test MSE.

#

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/loan.jpg"> **[Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/S-Omkar-K/Loan-Default-Prediction)** 

In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to detect consumers who will default the loan. SMOTE is used to combat class imbalance and LightGBM is implemented that resulted into the highest accuracy 98.89% and 0.99 F1 Score.
